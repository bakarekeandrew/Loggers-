Q1, What is a logger:
A logger is a component in software development used to record events, errors, warnings, and other information during the execution of an application. It provides a way to track what's happening in your application, which is crucial for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining software.

Q2, Why are loggers important:

Debugging: Loggers help developers understand the flow of their application and identify issues.
Monitoring: They allow for real-time monitoring of application behavior in production environments.
Auditing: Logs can be used to track user actions and system events for security and compliance purposes.
Performance analysis: By logging execution times, you can identify bottlenecks in your application.
Error tracking: Loggers capture detailed error information, including stack traces, which is crucial for troubleshooting.
Non-intrusive: Unlike using print statements, logging can be easily enabled or disabled without changing the code.
Configurability: Log levels and outputs can be configured externally, allowing for flexibility in different environments.

Q3, Understanding Logger Levels:

Logger levels represent the severity or importance of the logged message The common levels from least to most severe are:

Trace:
The most detailed level of logging.
Used for very fine-grained debugging, typically in development.
Example: Logging method entry and exit points, or variable values in loops.

Debug:
Detailed information useful for debugging.
More focused than TRACE, but still primarily for development use.
Example: "User attempted login with username: {username}"

Info:
General information about the application's operation.
Confirms that things are working as expected.
Example: "Application started successfully" or "User logged in: {username}"

Warn:
Indicates potential issues or unexpected events that don't prevent the application from functioning.
Used for events that should be noted but don't require immediate action.
Example: "Connection pool running low" or "Deprecated API called"

Error:
Used for errors that impact the operation of the application but don't cause it to stop.
These usually require investigation and often immediate attention.
Example: "Failed to connect to database" or "Unable to process user request"

Fatal:
The most severe level, used for critical errors that will likely lead to application failure.
These require immediate attention and often result in the application shutting down.
Example: "Out of memory error" or "Critical system component failed"
